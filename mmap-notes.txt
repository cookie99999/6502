0000-7fff 32k ram
8000-9fff 8k io
a000-dfff unmapped, 16k wasted
e000-ffff 8k rom

9000-900f via1 mirrored every 16 bytes until 9fff
8800-880f via2 mirrored every 16 bytes until 8fff
9800-9fff both selected: bad, don't do it

new map: a10 + /iocs selects 6551
8400-8403 6551, mirrored every 4 bytes until 87ff but also at 8c00-8fff and 9400-97ff and 9c00-9fff
basically this map is only safe if you promise not to use the danger zones
to improve it you need to put extra addr lines through the gal to decode more finely, like daryl rictors
